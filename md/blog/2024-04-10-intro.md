# I'm starting a blog

I've been thinking about starting a blog for some time now. I think it would be interesting to share some of my thoughts and experiences, some of the things I'm working on, and some of the things I've learned.

Don't expect regular updates, but I'll try to write something every now and then.
I'll write about software development, and maybe some personal stuff as well.

Also, I wanted to do this project to learn about the following tech:

- Remix
- CSS Modules
- Generating pages from markdown files
- Deploying to Netlify
