# Should the React.FC type?

When defining a functional components in React, we could decide to define the type
of the component, or just let TypeScript infer it. 

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
};
```

In the example above, TypeScript will infer the type of `MyComponent` as `() => JSX.Element`.

## JSX.Element type

The `JSX.Element` is a type that represents a React element.

In some cases we can return `string` or `null`, as these are also valid React elements.


```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
    value: string;
}

const MyComponent = ({value} : Props) => {
    return value ? <div>{value}</div> : null;
};
```

However, this opens up the possibility to return other types, like `number` or `boolean`, which are not valid React elements.
There is no compile time error, as there is no type explicitly defined.

## React.FC type

If we are using functional components (that is now recommended), we can set the type of the component to `React.FC`.
It is a generic type, where we can define the type of the props.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
    value: string;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({value}) => {
    return <div>{value}</div>;
};
```

Awesome! This will prevent us from returning invalid types.

## The caveat

Previously, until React 17, there was a caveat with the `React.FC` type, as it included the `children` prop by default,
even though it is not used in the component.

This behavior was removed in [React 18](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/commit/55dc209ceb6dbcd59c4c68cc8dfb77faadd9de12#diff-32cfd8cb197872bcba371f5018185d2e75fa540b52cda2dd7d8ac12dcc021299L550-L554)

How it caused an issue before:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
    value: string;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({children, value}) => {
    // `children` is available, even though it is not defined in the Props
    return <div>{value}</div>;
};
```

This behavior should be avoided, as some components should not have children, eg. an image, or a dividor line component.
Since React 18, this is not an issue anymore.

## Conclusion

Should you use `React.FC` type? It is up to you. 

If you want to be explicit about the type of the component, and prevent returning invalid types, then yes, you should use it.

Otherwise the props can be defined in the function signature, and TypeScript will infer the type of the component.
For accessing the `children` prop, you can use the `React.PropWithChildren` generic type.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
    value: string;
}

const MyComponent = ({value} : Props) => {
    return <div>{value}</div>;
};

const MyComponentWithChildren = ({children, value} : React.PropsWithChildren<Props>) => {
    return <div>
        <span>{value}</span>
        {children}
    </div>;
};
```
