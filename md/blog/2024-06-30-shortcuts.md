# VSCode Keyboard Shortcuts

I use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for most of my coding. It is a great editor with a lot of features, and it is free! One of the major disadvantages of VSCode is that it is pretty heavy, and I started to look for alternatives, but for now I am sticking with it.

Here are some of the shortcuts that I use frequently:

## File Shortcuts

| Shortcut      | Description                  |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| `Ctrl + P`    | Go to file                   |
| `Ctrl + W`    | Close file                   |
| `Ctrl + S`    | Save file                    |
| `Ctrl + K, S` | Save file without formatting |
| `F2`          | Rename file                  |


## Code Navigation

| Shortcut           | Description            |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| `Ctrl + G`         | Go to line             |
| `Ctrl + F`         | Find (in current file) |
| `Ctrl + Shift + F` | Find (in all files)    |
| `Ctrl + D`         | Find next occurrence   |
| `Ctrl + Shift + H` | Replace (in all files) |
